# PartyShare Codex Session Start

Before making changes:
1. Read `AGENTS.md` and repository-specific instructions.
2. Confirm branch and remote state.
3. Scope changes to the smallest viable patch.
4. Prefer existing PartyShare/Sharetribe patterns over introducing new abstractions.
5. Run formatting and tests relevant to touched files.

When done:
- Summarize changes with file-level references.
- Provide exact verification commands and outcomes.
